Who am I?

I am ack and ack with a ack ack. My ack is 
ack and my battle cry sounds like ack.  I am ack when I ack through
the ack.

If you want to find me, you need to ack and ack ack times before I
will greet you with a hearty "ack" and a resounding ack.  Then we will be
friends for life or as long as ack!
