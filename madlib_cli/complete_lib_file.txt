Who am I?

I am asf and asf with a asf asf. My asf is 
asf and my battle cry sounds like asf.  I am asf when I asf through
the asf.

If you want to find me, you need to asf and asf asf times before I
will greet you with a hearty "asf" and a resounding asf.  Then we will be
friends for life or as long as asf!
